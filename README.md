# Sandbox Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Sandbox Repository! This is a collection of experimental projects
and learning exercises in different programming languages and technologies. The
aim of this repository is to explore new concepts, test ideas, and etc.

## Projects

This repository contains various small projects. Each project focuses on
different aspects of programming and serves as a platform for experimentation
and learning. Notable projects include:

### Scala Notes Graph Project
