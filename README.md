# Sandbox Repo

## Overview

Welcome to my sandbox repo! This is a collection of experimental projects
and learning exercises in different programming languages and technologies. The
aim of this repository is to explore new concepts, test ideas, and etc.

## Projects

This repository contains various small projects. Each project focuses on
different aspects of programming and serves as a platform for experimentation
and learning. Projects include:

### Scala Notes Graph Project

- **Description**: This Scala-based project focuses on creating a graph structure
  from markdown notes. It parses markdown files to extract internal and external
  links, and then constructs a graph where nodes represent individual notes and
  edges depict the links between them.
- **Status**: Completed
- [Read More](./notesgraph/README.md)

### ID Generators

- **Description**: A set of classes designed for generating unique IDs, inspired
  by Twitter's Snowflake and Flickr's Ticket algorithms. This project was
  undertaken to explore non-UUID, time-sortable, unique identifiers.
- **Status**: Completed
- [Read More](./id-generators/README.md)

### Autocomplete Experiment

- **Description**: An exploration into building an efficient autocomplete
  querying system in Python. This project initially utilized a Trie data
  structure and evolved to implement a Prefix Hash Tree for enhanced performance.
- **Status**: Completed
- [Read More](./autocomplete/README.md)

### Get Wiki Data

- **Description**: These utility functions, written in Go, are designed for
  downloading and processing Wikipedia's data dumps. It focuses on parsing
  Wikipedia dump status files and downloading the relevant data. The project
  includes handling and downloading of page view data as well.
- **Status**: Completed
- [Read More](./get-wiki-data/README.md)
