# Rust Custom Shell - Rust Basics Project

**Note: This is a work in progress and not yet ready for general use.**

## Overview

This is a personal project where I'm developing a custom shell in Rust. The
primary goal is to deepen my understanding of Rust by building a practical,
command-line-based application. This project allows me to explore Rust's unique
features such as ownership, borrowing, and match statements, in a hands-on way.

## Features

- Execution of basic system commands.
- Maintenance of a history of commands executed.

## Project Status

This shell is currently a work in progress and serves as a platform for
experimenting with various Rust concepts and techniques.

## Running the Project

To run the Rust Custom Shell:

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `cargo run` in your terminal to start the shell.

## Note

As this is a personal learning project, it is primarily tailored to my learning
process in Rust and might not adhere strictly to all Rust best practices for
production-level code.
